RAPIDS provides unmatched speed with familiar APIs that match the most popular PyData libraries. 
Built on state-of-the-art foundations like NVIDIA CUDA and Apache Arrow, it unlocks the speed of GPUs with code you already know.

Utilizing NVIDIA CUDA primitives for low-level compute optimization, RAPIDS exposes GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly interfaces:

Dataframe processing with cuDF (similar API to pandas)
Machine learning with cuML (similar API to scikit-learn)
Graph processing with cuGraph (similar API to networkX)
Spatial analytics with cuSpatial (similar API to geoPandas)
Image processing with cuCIM (similar API to scikit-image)
Signal processing cuSignal (similar API to scipy.signal)
Seamless cross-filtered dashboards with cuxfilter
Low level compute primitives with RAFT
Apache Spark acceleration with Spark RAPIDS
